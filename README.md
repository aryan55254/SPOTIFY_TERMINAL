# Spotify Terminal Controller

## Overview

The **Spotify Terminal Controller** is a Node.js-based application that allows you to control your Spotify playback directly from the terminal. It provides an interactive interface to play, pause, skip tracks, adjust volume, and manage playlistsâ€”all without leaving your terminal.

This project uses the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to interact with Spotify's services. It leverages the `spotify-web-api-node` library for API communication and provides a simple, user-friendly terminal interface using `readline`.

     ```env
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here

     SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
     SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=your_playlist_id_here
     ```
   - Replace `your_client_id_here`, `your_client_secret_here`, and `your_playlist_id_here` with your actual Spotify app credentials and playlist ID.
